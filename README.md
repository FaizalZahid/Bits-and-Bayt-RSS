# Installing Chrome Extensions for Dummies:
## 0. `git clone https://github.com/FaizalZahid/Bits-and-Bayt-RSS.git` or download it as ZIP file

  since this is a private extension and unavailable on Chrome Store

## 2. Load unpacked and choose  folder you just `git clone` or `downloaded as ZIP file`

   it's supposed to be automatically enabled, so this is pretty much skippable

Simple, isn't it? It's called **R**eally **S**imple **S**yndication. Now add or remove as many RSS sources that you want and you're good to go!
Enjoy reading!
